//! Common types used by other Holochain crates.
//!
//! This crate is a complement to the [holochain_zome_types crate](https://crates.io/crates/holochain_zome_types), which contains only the essential types which are used in Holochain DNA code. This crate expands on those types to include all types which Holochain itself depends on.
